# What needs to be covered
- Objective(s) and target group(s), and their alignment with the DDSAâ€™s objectives (https://ddsa.dk/about/background-objectives/)
- Value to the Danish data science community, and alignment between budget and value
- Contribution to community building and translation across disciplines, sectors, and regions
- Description of content, schedule, speakers/teachers, venue etc. For courses, also learning objectives, teaching methods, and ECTS

# Ideas

### Danstar (Danish Student Association for Rocketry)
- [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnzVhoCY2pk)
- A talk from a tech lead about the main challenges of building a rocket and how does/can data solve these challenges
- What Data Science practices do they employ
- How do they collect and use data (edge ML) 
- They could provide a dataset and other data scientists in Denmark would need to come up with the best insights/solutions (similar to Kaggle competitions)

Notes:
- This came from an idea when Rasmus talked about how SpaceX uses the library (CVXPY) to balance their rockets when landing
- From their Team description they don't seem to have a Data Science team (or a person)
- This would well align with the goal of DDSA of fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing across disciplines

### Anders Nyman
One of the speakers at the Nordics Summit he is an engineering manager at Spotify
- A talk about what MLOps techniques do they deploy at huge companies such as Spotify
- He is currently working on improving the search feature, what all kinds of data comes in play with such feature?

### Bo (founder) or Chaoyu (engineer)
A talk about BentoML, walkthrough tutorial with a Q&A session

### Data Innovation Summit Nordics
Event for the Nordics region that brings together the most influential speakers and organisations to address the biggest topics in AI and innovation.

Notes:
- I am not sure if conferences like this also go under what DDSA can cover(probably not), but surely well aligns with development and learning of the data science community in Denmark

### Talks from Data Scientists in Denmark
Similar as the concept of Computas Day. Select data scientists from denmark (professors, researchers, from industry) where each will get a certain amount of time to present their current research/field of interest.
