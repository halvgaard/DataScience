    "Predictive CLV is a high impact ML business use case. CLV is a customer's past value plus their predicted future value. The goal of predictive CLV is to predict how much monetary value a user will bring to the business in a defined future time range based on historical transactions.\n",

These customers, with higher lifetime value, are your main marketing target to increase revenue.\n",

    "From the chart and quantiles, you can see that half of the customers have less than or equal to only 2 purchases. You can also tell from the average purchases > median purchases and max purchases of 81 that there are customers, likely wholesalers, who have made significantly more purchases. This should have you already thinking about feature engineering opportunities such as bucketizing purchases and removing or clipping outlier customers. You can also explore alternative modeling strategies for CLV on new customers who have only made 1 purchase as the approach demonstrated in this lab will perform better on customers with more relationship transactional history.

Looking at the quantiles, it is clear there are a few outlier customers whose monetary value is greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean. With this small dataset, it is recommended to remove these outlier customer values to treat separately, change your model's loss function to be more resistant to outliers, log the target feature, or clip their values to a maximum threshold. You should also be revisiting your CLV business requirements to see if binning customer monetary value and reframing this as a ML classification problem would suit your needs."

Use a Google Cloud prebuilt container**: if you use a Vertex AI prebuilt container, you will write a Python `task.py` script or Python package to install into the container image that defines your code for training a custom model. See [Creating a Python training application for a pre-built container](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/create-python-pre-built-container) for more details on how to structure you Python code. Choose this option if a prebuilt container already contains the model training libraries you need such as `tensorflow` or `xgboost` and you are just doing ML training and prediction quickly. You can also specific additional Python dependencies to install through the `CustomTrainingJob(requirements=...` argument.\n",

Use your own custom container image**: If you want to use your own custom container, you will write your Python training scripts and a Dockerfile that contains instructions on your ML model code, dependencies, and execution instructions. You will build your custom container with Cloud Build, whose instructions are specified in `cloudbuild.yaml` and publish your container to your Artifact Registry. Choose this option if you want to package your ML model code with dependencies together in a container to build toward running as part of a portable and scalable [Vertex Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction) workflow.

It also identified the relatively lengthy days since last purchase as negatively impacting the prediction. Using these insights, you can plan for an experiment to evaluate targeted marketing interventions for this repeat customer, such as volume discounts, to encourage this customer to purchase more frequently in order to drive additional revenue."

In this lab, you walked through a machine learning experimentation workflow using Google Cloud's BigQuery for data storage and analysis and Vertex AI machine learning services to train and deploy a TensorFlow model to predict customer lifetime value. You progressed from training a TensorFlow model locally to training on the cloud with Vertex AI and leveraged several new unified platform capabilities such as Vertex TensorBoard and Explainable AI prediction feature attributions."
